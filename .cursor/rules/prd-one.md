Product Requirements Document: Gaming-Agent

1. Overview

Project Name: Gaming-Agent
Description: An end-to-end CLI-based agent that transforms a plain-English game concept into a fully functional Love2D (Lua) retro arcade game, automating design spec generation, asset creation, code scaffolding, integration, testing, and packaging.

2. Objectives
	•	Automate the entire game development pipeline for simple 2D arcade-style games.
	•	Enable rapid prototyping from concept to playable build in under 10 minutes.
	•	Maintain modularity, allowing easy swapping of sub-agents (Planner, Art Generator, Code Generator, Integrator, Tester, Builder).
	•	Provide clear CLI UX and configuration, making the tool accessible to novice developers.

3. Target Audience
	•	Indie developers learning game dev.
	•	Hobbyists who want to prototype retro arcade games quickly.
	•	Educators demonstrating automated pipelines.

4. MVP Scope
	1.	Genre Focus: 2D arcade-style games (e.g., top-down shooters, maze-chase, platform-lite).
	2.	Core Pipeline Stages:
	•	Concept → Design Spec (Markdown)
	•	Asset List → Placeholder Pixel Art (Aseprite CLI)
	•	Code Scaffolding → Love2D Template (Lua)
	•	Integration → Wire assets & code
	•	Smoke Test → Headless run for crashes
	•	Packaging → love-release build 
	3.	CLI Commands: init, plan, generate-assets, scaffold, build, publish.

5. Features & Functional Requirements

Feature	Description	Acceptance Criteria
CLI Initialization	gaming-agent init <project-name> scaffolds folder, Git init, basic files.	Creates folder, Git repo, README.md, main.lua, conf.lua, .gitignore.
Spec Generation	gaming-agent plan --prompt "<concept>" outputs arcade_spec.md.	Generates a filled Markdown spec matching template.
Asset Automation	gaming-agent generate-assets creates placeholder sprites via Aseprite CLI.	Produces /assets/sprites.png and JSON frame data.
Code Scaffolding	gaming-agent scaffold populates template Lua files based on spec.	player.lua, enemy.lua, etc. contain functional stubs.
Integration & Run	gaming-agent run launches Love2D project to verify no errors.	Game window opens without crashes; input moves a placeholder sprite.
Packaging & Deployment	gaming-agent build and gaming-agent publish packages and pushes build.	Builds binaries for Win/Mac/Linux; uploads via Butler to itch.io.

6. Non-Functional Requirements
	•	Performance: Smoke tests complete in <10s.
	•	Usability: CLI help texts for each command.
	•	Extensibility: Config file for custom asset pipelines and templates.
	•	Reliability: Automated re-prompting on test failures.

7. Technical Architecture
	1.	Orchestrator: Python script (agent.py) using OpenAI API + Aseprite CLI + Git + sub-processes.
	2.	Templates: Stored in template/ directory with placeholders (-- TODO).
	3.	Persistence: Local Git for versions; optional JSON manifest for context.
	4.	Testing: Python harness invoking love . --headless and parsing stderr.

8. User Stories
	1.	As a novice dev, I want to scaffold a new arcade project so I don’t write boilerplate.
	2.	As a designer, I want to see a design spec generated so I can review the game concept.
	3.	As a coder, I want placeholder assets so I can iterate on feel before final art.
	4.	As a QA, I want automated smoke tests so I catch crashes early.

9. Acceptance Criteria
	•	CLI commands execute without unhandled exceptions.
	•	Generated spec and code compile/run under Love2D without errors.
	•	Placeholder art loads correctly and displays in-game.
	•	Build artifacts (zips, binaries) are created and valid.

10. Milestones & Roadmap
	1.	Week 1: CLI init, Git integration, basic template.
	2.	Week 2: Design Spec (plan) and Asset Automation.
	3.	Week 3: Code Scaffolding and Integration.
	4.	Week 4: Testing harness and Build/Publish commands.
	5.	Week 5: Documentation, examples, and user feedback loop.

11. Open Questions & Next Steps
	•	Do we need a web/Electron UI or is CLI-only sufficient at first?
	•	Which Aseprite slice templates are mandatory for MVP?
	•	How to handle custom palettes vs. default 8-color palette?
